"@astaella @robcorddry ""The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I’ve tried to learn from them.

"Agree 1000%.  Just look at Louis C.K. to see the culture of raunch &amp; misogyny in comedy.   I’m hoping men in that business are rethinking that now - but within that culture, AF’s bad joke was practically G-rated. The accuser forgave him.  It should be her call. https://t.co/qYMN81886A","Bakersfield, CA",1.70000004768,-0.20000000298,2017-11-18 12:08:09,jerimickelberry

"@carltonautism This reminds me of a Louis C.K joke where he said he wanted to be able to masturbate rapidly and cum in people's faces as a defense mechanism.
And when he voiced his desire to jerk off on women's faces, and force Christians to watch him masturbate.
