Why did Netflix cut ties with Spacey and Louis C.K. with the same level of evidence? Why hasn’t the prosecutor made a decision on whether to lay charges? What’s going on?! https://t.co/eeQr1Ci7oX,"Wisconsin, USA",0.800000011921,-0.10000000149,2017-11-18 17:06:19,KittyKat_Meow27

"Jon Stewart learned about the Louis C.K. allegations in 2016, but C.K. wasn't cut from Stewart's HBO special ""Night of Too Many Stars"" until yesterday. I have questions about this, and I wrote about them.

"Based on my writing &amp; re-tweeting, I thought it was clear that I find what Louis C.K. did reprehensible &amp; an abuse of privilege &amp; power as a man, as a famous man &amp; as a famous man who was in positions where others saw him as a mentor &amp; trusted him. I’m sorry if this was not clear https://t.co/O0PVb9OQgj",Sydney,1.29999995232,-0.40000000596,2017-11-18 16:51:36,james_mathurin_
"For a decade I held Louis C.K. on a pedestal as a comic genius and a moral voice against The Man. Now I see him holed up, his legacy destroyed, and I find myself re-thinking ambition, success. Gain the world and lose the soul sort of thing.","Torrance, CA",1.70000004768,0.40000000596,2017-11-18 16:46:39,herculodge
