Goal: Twitter Dashboard that shows trends on whatever topic you enter. It will show a time series plot, location choropleth and sentiment analysis possibly broken down by demographic bar chart.

Need:
1. Twitter API
 1. Port auth keys, etc to json
2. plotly dashboard
3. Plotly plots
 1. Choropleth (USA)
 2. Time series line graph (number of mentions)
 3. Sentiment analysis (bar chart)
4. User search term to query twitter api
5. Simple instructions

Looks like twitter stores a descent amount of data in their API. You can grab the location, time, and more, but only in a 7-day window.
- Only gives data from past 20-30 minutes. Created a script that runs every hour. Will let run for a week.
